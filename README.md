# BGC Knowledge Base

This repository provides a modular and structured guide to the **fundamentals of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs)** and the tools used to detect and analyze them, such as **antiSMASH**, **GECCO**. It is designed to support ongoing research while serving as a reference for others learning about BGCs and natural product biosynthesis.

The content is organized by topic to allow focused exploration of:

* Core concepts and classifications of BGCs
* Common protein domains and modular logic
* Software tools used in BGC prediction and annotation
* Examples of interpreting real-world tool outputs

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Establish a reliable reference for the structure and function of BGCs
* Summarize tools and methods used for domain detection and annotation
* Serve as a live notebook to track learning and insights gained from hands-on data
* Provide clear, concise examples for interpreting BGC prediction outputs
