# Major Types of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs)

This document outlines the **major types of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs)** found in bacterial and fungal genomes, describing the types of compounds they produce, the enzymes involved, and relevant biosynthetic logic.

## 🧱 1. **PKS – Polyketide Synthase**

Polyketides are structurally diverse natural products built by polyketide synthases.

### 🔹 Key Features:

* Modular or iterative biosynthesis
* Uses acyl-CoA building blocks (e.g., malonyl-CoA)
* Often includes domains: **KS, AT, DH, KR, ACP, TE**

### 🔹 Types:

* **Type I PKS**: Large, multifunctional proteins with multiple modules (modular)
* **Type II PKS**: Discrete, monofunctional enzymes (mostly aromatic polyketides)
* **Type III PKS**: Simple homodimeric enzymes (plant-type chalcone synthases)

### 🔹 Products:

* Erythromycin, Tetracycline, Avermectin

---

## 🔗 2. **NRPS – Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase**

Produces peptides independent of the ribosome, often containing non-standard amino acids.

### 🔹 Key Features:

* Modular architecture: **C, A, PCP** domains
* Builds peptide chains by sequential addition
* Incorporates D-amino acids, modified residues, or fatty acids

### 🔹 Products:

* Vancomycin, Bacitracin, Surfactin

---

## 🔀 3. **Hybrid PKS-NRPS Clusters**

Contain modules from both PKS and NRPS, creating highly complex molecules.

### 🔹 Features:

* Alternate between polyketide and peptide segments
* Hybrid megasynth(et)ases

### 🔹 Products:

* Epothilone, Bleomycin, Yersiniabactin

---

## 📜 4. **RiPPs – Ribosomally Synthesized and Post-translationally Modified Peptides**

These peptides are initially produced by the ribosome and then enzymatically modified.

### 🔹 Key Features:

* Core peptide encoded in a precursor gene
* Modified by tailoring enzymes (e.g., cyclases, oxidases)

### 🔹 Classes:

* Lantipeptides, Thiopeptides, Bottromycins

### 🔹 Products:

* Nisin, Thiostrepton, Microviridins

---

## 🌿 5. **Terpene Clusters**

Produce terpenoids derived from isoprenoid building blocks.

### 🔹 Key Features:

* Made from **isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP)** and **dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP)**
* Involve **terpene synthases** and **prenyltransferases**
* Common in bacteria, fungi, and plants

### 🔹 Products:

* Geosmin (earthy smell), Squalene, Lycopene, Carotenoids

---

## 🍬 6. **Saccharide Clusters (Polysaccharide or Glycoside Pathways)**

Encode the machinery to produce complex sugars, glycosylated molecules, or capsules.

### 🔹 Key Features:

* Involve **glycosyltransferases**, **sugar epimerases**, **dehydratases**, and more
* May be involved in extracellular polysaccharides or secondary metabolite glycosylation

### 🔹 Products:

* Capsular polysaccharides, Glycosylated antibiotics (e.g., Streptomycin)

---

## 🧪 7. **Alkaloid Clusters**

Produce nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds derived from amino acids.

### 🔹 Features:

* Derived from tryptophan, lysine, or tyrosine
* Require decarboxylases, methyltransferases, cyclases

### 🔹 Products:

* Ergot alkaloids, Indolocarbazoles (e.g., Rebeccamycin)

---

## 🔬 8. **Phenazine and Other Aromatic Compounds**

Use shikimate-derived pathways or other aromatic precursors.

### 🔹 Products:

* Phenazine, Violacein, Actinorhodin
